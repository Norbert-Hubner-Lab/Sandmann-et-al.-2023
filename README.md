# Analyzing the evolution of ORF sequences and structures across primate and mammalian species
This repository contains a series of scripts developed to obtain the main results of the manuscript X.

**-evolution_orfs:** Scripts to build multiple alignments of ORF sequences, reconstruct ancestral sequences, and evaluate the sequence conservation of ORFs across the included species.
